# Learning Backbone

####Following along with Addy Osmani's book Backbone Fundementals.

My process is I guess typical:

I go through each chapter, write notes down and play with the examples until I understand each concept.

Then, I type the notes up to practice my markdown and review the chapter.

There's no actual purpose for this repo to exist other than me wanting to practice git skills and have a central repo for it
once the examples start getting complex.

So far, it's just a bunch of notes... Which are basically condensed versions of the actual book -_-.
