# Learning Backbone

####Following along with Addy Osmani's book Backbone Fundementals.


There's no actual purpose for this repo to exist other than me wanting to practice git skills and have a central repo for it
once the examples start getting complex.

So far, it's just a bunch of notes... Which are basically condensed versions of the actual book -_-.
